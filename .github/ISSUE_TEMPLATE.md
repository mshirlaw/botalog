Greetings. This template is for people submitting their bot to the index, if you are making an issue related to something else you can safely remove this text!

**What you need (fill in the blanks)**

- The bot's name:
- A link to the bot link (usually through http://m.me, eg. https://m.me/cnn for CNN, https://m.me/wsj for WSJ):
- The name of the company or individual who published the bot:
- A link to the page relevant to the entity who published the bot:
- The description of the bot:
- Some categories which apply to the bot (can be either `game`, `productivity`, `on demand`, `fun`, `media`, or `money`):
- Some relevant tags/keywords which apply to the bot (can be whatever you want to make your bot more searchable):
- If the bot has not been officially accepted by Facebook, a link where people can comment to become testers (eg. https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=473383312871039&id=471938779682159):

If you've completed these steps you're ready to go, also:
